## Introduction

Online reviews play a crucial role in informing consumers' decisions. However, the presence of fake or spam reviews can distort this information. FakeReviewSpamDetector helps address this problem by providing tools to:

- Analyze sentiment in reviews.
- Engineer features from review text.
- Classify reviews as positive or negative.
- Detect fake or spam reviews based on various characteristics.

This project utilizes libraries like NLTK, pandas, scikit-learn, and more to achieve these tasks.

## Features

- Sentiment analysis of reviews.
- Feature engineering for textual data.
- Classification of reviews using different machine learning classifiers:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Visualization of review characteristics.
- Comparison of classifier accuracies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can use FakeReviewSpamDetector, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- NLTK library
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (for running Jupyter notebooks, if desired)

You can install these prerequisites using Python's package manager, pip.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jordanbecker1/FakeReviewSpamDetector.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install nltk pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Usage

To use FakeReviewSpamDetector, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have your review data in a CSV file, such as 'FakeReviews.csv,' and place it in the project directory.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform sentiment analysis, feature engineering, classification, and comparisons.

   ```bash
   python fake_review_spam_detector.py
   ```

4. The results will be displayed in the terminal, and visualizations will be saved in the project directory.

## Feature Engineering

FakeReviewSpamDetector performs feature engineering on review text, including calculating word count, character count, uppercase count, exclamation count, average word length, and stopword count. These features are used for classification and analysis.

## Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is conducted using the VADER sentiment analysis tool. The project calculates sentiment scores and labels reviews as 'positive' or 'negative' based on their compound sentiment score.

## Classification

FakeReviewSpamDetector uses multiple classifiers, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to classify reviews as genuine or fake. Classifier accuracies and confusion matrices are provided for evaluation.

## Comparing Classifiers

The project includes a visualization of classifier accuracies to help you assess the performance of different classification algorithms.
